The setup.py file is included in case you don't trust running the offered standalone programs and want to compile make your own standalone program from the gcount-tasks.py script.

You do not need to run setup.py if you are comfortable using the provided standalone program for your system. Just look over the README.md to see how to get it running.

If you want to generate your own standalone, get started by reading the docstring in the setup.py file. You may need to download, from the URL in the docstring, a python program that actually does the compiling.
