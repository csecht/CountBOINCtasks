The setup.py file is included in case you don't trust running the offered standalone programs and want to compile your own standalone from the gcount-tasks.py script.

You do not need setup.py if you are comfortable using the provided standalone program for your system; just look over the README.md for instructions to get the standalong running.

If you want to generate your own standalone, get started by reading the docstring in the setup.py file. You may need to download, from the URL provided in the docstring, a python program that actually does the compiling.
