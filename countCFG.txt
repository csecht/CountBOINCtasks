# If you have moved BOINC components from their default install location, you
# can either enter a custom path for the boinccmd executable on the command
# line when executing the count-task.py script, or enter your custom path here
# to make it permanently available to count-task.py.
# To use a custom path, remove the leading # from the "custom_path" line,
# below, and replace the example path with your path. Enter it as you would
# for a terminal command to execute the boinccmd program (without arguments).

### Do not rename this file.
### Keep this file in the CountBOINCtasks-master folder.

# Path examples (BOINC default paths):
## Windows: \Program Files\BOINC\boinccmd.exe
## Linux:   /usr/bin/boinccmd
## Mac OS:  $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/BOINC/boinccmd

#custom_path /usr/bin/boinccmd
