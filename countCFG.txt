# If you have not yet installed BOINC, read this:
#    https://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Installing_BOINC\n'

### Do not rename this file.
### Keep it, or its alias-symlink, in the CountBOINCtasks-master folder.

# If you have moved BOINC components from their default install location,
# you can run gcount-tasks by entering your custom BOINC path below.

# To use a custom path, remove the leading # from the "custom_path" line,
# and write your system path using the examples as template. Generally,
# you should enter it as you would for in the command line to execute the
# boinccmd program (without arguments).
# Note that in the macOS Terminal, while you would need to escape a
# space in a folder name, e.g. /Application\ Support/, or use double quotes
# around a path that contained spaces, you do not need escapes or quotes for
# this custom_path.

# Path examples (BOINC default paths):
# Windows: \Program Files\BOINC\boinccmd.exe
# Linux:   /usr/bin/boinccmd
# MacOS:  $HOME/Library/Application Support/BOINC/boinccmd
# Note: On macOS, the Terminal command line would be entered as:
# /Users/youtheuser/Library/Application\ Support/BOINC/boinccmd

#custom_path <uncomment this line and put your custom path here, without brackets.>
