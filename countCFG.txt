# If you have moved BOINC components from their default install location, you
# can either enter a custom path for the boinccmd executable on the command
# line when executing the count-task.py script, or enter your custom path below
# to make it permanently available to count-tasks.py.

# To use a custom path here, remove the leading # from the "custom_path" line,
# and replace the example path with your path. Enter it as you would for a
# terminal command to execute the boinccmd program (without arguments).
# Note that in the Mac OS shell, while you would need to escape a
# space in a folder name, e.g. /Application\ Support/, or use double quotes
# around a path that contained spaces, you do not need escapes or quotes for
# this custom_path.

### Do not rename this file.
### Keep this file in the CountBOINCtasks-master folder.

# Path examples (BOINC default paths):
# Windows: \Program Files\BOINC\boinccmd.exe
# Linux:   /usr/bin/boinccmd
# Mac OS:  $HOME/Library/Application Support/BOINC/boinccmd

#custom_path $HOME/Library/Application Support/BOINC/boinccmd
