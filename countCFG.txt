# If you have not yet installed BOINC, read this:
#    https://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Installing_BOINC\n'

### Do not rename this file.
### Keep it, or its alias-symlink, in the CountBOINCtasks-master folder.

# If you have moved BOINC components from their default install location,
# you can run count-tasks or gcount-tasks by entering your custom BOINC
# path here on the last line.

# Generally, you should enter your custom path as you would in a command
# line used to execute the boinccmd program (but without arguments).
# Note that in the macOS Terminal, while you would need to escape a
# space in a folder name, e.g. /Application\ Support/, or use double quotes
# around a path that contained spaces, do not use escapes or quotes in
# the custom_path line below.

# Example path formats using BOINC default paths found on different platforms.
#   Use the general structure for your system, but replace the example
#   paths with the path to your boinccmd program.
# Windows: \Program files\BOINC\boinccmd.exe
# Linux:   /usr/bin/boinccmd
# MacOS:  $HOME/Library/Application Support/BOINC/boinccmd
#       Note: On macOS, the equivalent Terminal command line would be:
#       /Users/youtheuser/Library/Application\ Support/BOINC/boinccmd

# Remove the "#", retain "custom_path ", and insert your desired path.
#custom_path your/custom/path/goes/here
